# Refactor-Challenge1
Changed some <div></div> to read as <section></section> or <header></header> or <nav></nav>
Should only change div to section if it is in fact, starting a new section of the code.  Not all divs should change, if the code works.  
All the images were missing alt ="" identifier so I added them.  
Since I changed some <div> to other syntax, I had to change the css coressponding to it.
